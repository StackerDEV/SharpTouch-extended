# SharpTouch-extended

Project git cloned from https://github.com/finalpatch/SharpTouch

This project has added functionality because some hardware vendors ship Synaptics driver software that not all people like.
Therefore I've extended Sharp Touch. Hence the name, Sharp Touch-extended. 

## Why

The project itself was functional but it was missing some options compared to the vendor Synaptics frontend, so these "extra" options have been added.

## Todo

* Refactor code?
* Add 3 and 4 finger gestures
* Tab to configure button maps
* Graphical region select for vertical/horizontal scrolling areas
* Graphical region select for navigation in button areas
* Option to switch between right/left handed operator
* Suggest some more extended functionality..

The application has been tested on a Dell 3570 with a TM-P3017 PS2 board without pointerstick (MPN 92000252301REVA)
